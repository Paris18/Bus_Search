Email Service

Create a service that accepts the necessary information and sends emails. It should provide an abstraction between two different email service providers. If one of the services goes down, your service can quickly failover to a different provider without affecting your customers.

Example Email Providers:

    SendGrid - Simple Send Documentation
    Mailgun - Simple Send Documentation
    Mandrill - Simple Send Documentation
    Amazon SES - Simple Send Documentation

All listed services are free to try and are pretty painless to sign up for, so please register your own test accounts on each.
